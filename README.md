# SvelteKit + SvelteTip Demo App

This is a boilerplate app for SvelteKit with SvelteTip installed. For more detailed instructions, please click [here](https://www.sveltetip.com/home/install).

## Install

Clone or download this app:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/allenRoyston/sveltetip-new-project.git

cd svelte sveltetip-new-project
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.

## Production

```bash
npm run build

npm run start
```

A full guide for production builds can be found [here](https://www.sveltetip.com/home/production).
